# AutoAgent

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental Project**: This project was created during a hackathon at the Cursor offices on September 10, 2025. Use at your own risk. Future updates will focus on making it production CI/CD ready. üöß  - Thank you to the Curosr team for hosting!

A composable GitHub Action that integrates with AI agents like [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli), [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), and [Amp Code](https://ampcode.com/) to run prompts on a repository as part of Pull Request workflows.

## Features

- **Predefined Rules**: Run curated rules like OWASP security checks or refactoring suggestions
- **Custom Prompt Support**: Extend analysis with team-specific custom instructions
- **Agent Auto Installation**: Automatically installs the agent unless explicitly disabled
- **Multiple Agents Support**: Supports multiple AI coding agents: `cursor`, `claude`, `gemini`, `codex`, and `amp`
- **PR Comment Output**: Posts results back to GitHub PR comments in a structured format

```

Add this to your workflow file to ensure the action can post comments to pull requests.

## Setup

### 1. Add API Key Based on Your Agent

The action requires an API key environment variable to be set as a repository secret based on the agent you choose:

#### For Cursor Agent:

1. **Get your Cursor API key**:
   - Open Cursor IDE
   - Go to Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
   - Navigate to **General** ‚Üí **Account**
   - Copy your API key from the account section

2. **Add the secret**: Add `CURSOR_API_KEY` as a repository secret

#### For Claude Code:

1. **Get your Anthropic API key**:
   - Go to [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
   - Navigate to **API Keys**
   - Create a new API key or copy an existing one

2. **Add the secret**: Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a repository secret

#### For Gemini CLI:

1. **Get your Google API key**:
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new API key or use an existing one
   - Alternatively, authenticate with Google login (free tier: 60 requests/minute)

2. **Add the secret**: Add `GOOGLE_API_KEY` as a repository secret

#### For Codex CLI:

1. **Get your OpenAI API key**:
   - Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create a new API key or use an existing one
   - Alternatively, sign in with your ChatGPT account (Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise)

2. **Add the secret**: Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` as a repository secret

#### For Amp Code:

1. **Get your Amp API key**:
   - Go to [Amp Code](https://ampcode.com/)
   - Sign up or log in to your account
   - Run `amp login` in your terminal to authenticate
   - Your API key will be stored locally and can be found in the credentials file

2. **Add the secret**: Add `AMP_API_KEY` as a repository secret

#### Steps to add any secret to your repository:
- Go to your GitHub repository
- Click **Settings** (in the repository toolbar)
- In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
- Click **New repository secret**
- Name: Use the appropriate key name for your agent
- Value: Paste your API key
- Click **Add secret**

**Important**: The API key must be added as a repository secret, not as an environment variable in the workflow file directly.

### 2. Add Workflow Permissions

Add the permissions block to your workflow file (see Permissions section above).

## Error Handling

The action will fail gracefully with descriptive error messages for:
- Missing rule files
- Agent installation failures
- Invalid input formats
- Missing required tools
