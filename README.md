# AutoAgent

A composable GitHub Action that integrates with AI agents like [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.sh) to run prompts on a repository as part of Pull Request workflows.

## Features

- **Predefined Rules**: Run curated rules like OWASP security checks or refactoring suggestions
- **Custom Prompt Support**: Extend analysis with team-specific custom instructions
- **Agent Auto Installation**: Automatically installs the agent unless explicitly disabled
- **Multiple Agents Support**: Pluggable agent support, starting with `cursor`
- **PR Comment Output**: Posts results back to GitHub PR comments in a structured format

## Usage

### Basic Example

```yaml
name: AutoAgent Checks

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  autoagent:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run AutoAgent
        uses: erans/autoagent@v1
        with:
          rules: |
            - owasp-check
            - code-review
          custom: |
            Please check for inefficient SQL queries and suggest optimizations.
          action: comment
          install-agent: true
          agent: cursor
```

### Advanced Example

```yaml
name: AutoAgent Security & Quality Checks

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  autoagent:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run AutoAgent
        uses: erans/autoagent@v1
        with:
          rules: |
            - owasp-check
            - code-review
            - refactor-suggestions
          custom: |
            Please analyze the database schema changes and ensure they follow our naming conventions.
            Also check for any potential performance issues with the new queries.
          action: comment
          install-agent: true
          agent: cursor
```

### Custom Prompt Only Example

```yaml
name: AutoAgent Custom Analysis

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  autoagent:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run AutoAgent
        uses: erans/autoagent@v1
        with:
          custom: |
            Please review this pull request for:
            1. Code quality and best practices
            2. Security vulnerabilities
            3. Performance optimizations
            4. Documentation completeness
          action: comment
          install-agent: true
          agent: cursor
```

## Requirements

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be available in the runner environment
- For YAML parsing: `yq` (optional, falls back to `jq`)
- For JSON parsing: `jq`
- **Cursor API Key** - Required for cursor-agent to work (add as repository secret `CURSOR_API_KEY`)

## Environment Variables

- **`CURSOR_API_KEY`** - Required for Cursor CLI authentication
- **`MODEL`** - Optional AI model to use (defaults to `gpt-5`)

## Permissions

The action requires the following GitHub token permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write
```

Add this to your workflow file to ensure the action can post comments to pull requests.

## Setup

### 1. Add Cursor API Key

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `CURSOR_API_KEY`
5. Value: Your Cursor API key (get it from [Cursor Settings](https://cursor.sh/settings))

### 2. Add Workflow Permissions

Add the permissions block to your workflow file (see Permissions section above).

## Error Handling

The action will fail gracefully with descriptive error messages for:
- Missing rule files
- Agent installation failures
- Invalid input formats
- Missing required tools
