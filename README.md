# AutoAgent

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental Project**: This project was created during a hackathon at the Cursor offices on September 10, 2025. Use at your own risk. Future updates will focus on making it production CI/CD ready. üöß  - Thank you to the Curosr team for hosting!

A composable GitHub Action that integrates with AI agents like [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli), [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), and [Amp Code](https://ampcode.com/) to run prompts on a repository as part of Pull Request workflows.

## Features

- **Predefined Rules**: Run curated rules like OWASP security checks or refactoring suggestions
- **Custom Prompt Support**: Extend analysis with team-specific custom instructions
- **Agent Auto Installation**: Automatically installs the agent unless explicitly disabled
- **Multiple Agents Support**: Supports multiple AI coding agents: `cursor`, `claude`, `gemini`, `codex`, and `amp`
- **Configurable Scope**: Analyze only changed files (fast) or entire codebase (comprehensive)
- **PR Comment Output**: Posts results back to GitHub PR comments in a structured format
- **Composable Python Architecture**: Built with maintainable, modular Python code for better reliability and extensibility
- **Configurable Logging**: Debug mode for troubleshooting with detailed execution information

          action: comment
          install-agent: true
          agent: amp
```

### Analysis Scope Configuration

AutoAgent supports two analysis modes controlled by the `scope` parameter:

#### üöÄ **Changed Files Mode (Default)** - `scope: "changed"`

This mode analyzes only files that have been modified in the Pull Request, making it faster and more cost-effective by focusing AI analysis on the actual changes.

**How it works:**
- Automatically detects all files changed in the PR across all commits
- Uses multiple git diff strategies for maximum compatibility
- Provides changed file list context to AI agents
- Falls back to GitHub API when git history is insufficient
- Works with merge commits, rebases, and complex PR scenarios

**Key Benefits:**
- ‚ö° **Faster execution** - Only processes changed files
- üí∞ **Token efficient** - Reduces API costs significantly
- üéØ **Focused analysis** - AI concentrates on actual changes
- üîÑ **Auto-detection** - Handles complex git scenarios automatically

**Requirements for Changed Files Mode:**
- Must use `fetch-depth: 0` in checkout action (see examples below)
- Requires GitHub CLI (`gh`) for API fallback
- Works best with proper base branch setup

#### Analyze Only Changed Files (Default - Faster)
```yaml
name: AutoAgent - Changed Files Only

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

jobs:
  autoagent:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Required for proper changed file detection
      - name: Run AutoAgent on Changed Files
        uses: erans/autoagent@main
        env:
          CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
        with:
          rules: |
            - owasp-check
            - code-review
          scope: "changed"  # This is the default
          action: comment
          agent: cursor
```

#### üîç **Full Codebase Mode** - `scope: "all"`

This mode performs comprehensive analysis of the entire repository codebase, useful for security audits, architectural reviews, or when you need complete coverage.

**When to use:**
- Security audits requiring full codebase review
- Architectural analysis and refactoring suggestions
- Initial code quality assessment
- Compliance reviews and documentation checks

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Slower execution** - Processes entire codebase
- üí∏ **Higher cost** - Uses more API tokens
- üìä **Comprehensive coverage** - No missed dependencies or context
- üîé **Deep analysis** - Can catch broader architectural issues

#### Analyze Entire Codebase (Comprehensive)
```yaml
name: AutoAgent - Full Codebase Analysis

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

jobs:
  autoagent:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Required for proper changed file detection
      - name: Run AutoAgent on Entire Codebase
        uses: erans/autoagent@main
        env:
          CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
        with:
          rules: |
            - owasp-check
            - code-review
          scope: "all"  # Analyze entire codebase
          action: comment
          agent: cursor
```

### Troubleshooting Changed Files Detection

If you see `"No changed files detected"` in the output, enable debug logging first to get detailed information:

```yaml
- name: Run AutoAgent with Debug
  uses: erans/autoagent@main
  with:
    logging: debug  # Enable detailed debugging
    # ... other parameters
```

Then try these solutions based on the debug output:

#### **Issue: Shallow Clone**
```yaml
# ‚ùå This may cause detection issues
- uses: actions/checkout@v4

# ‚úÖ Use this instead
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0  # Required for changed file detection
```

#### **Issue: Missing Base Branch**
The action automatically fetches the base branch, but ensure your workflow runs on pull request events:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]  # All required events
```

#### **Issue: Complex Merge Scenarios**
AutoAgent uses 8 different detection strategies including:
- Merge-base calculation
- GitHub API fallback
- Merge commit detection
- Multiple git diff approaches

Check the debug output to see which strategy succeeded.

#### **Issue: Permissions**
Ensure your workflow has proper permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read        # Required for checkout
  pull-requests: write  # Required for comments
  issues: write         # Required for GitHub API
```

### Advanced Example

```yaml
name: AutoAgent Security & Quality Checks

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

jobs:
  autoagent:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run AutoAgent
        uses: erans/autoagent@main
        env:
          CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
        with:
          rules: |
            - owasp-check
            - code-review
            - refactor-suggestions

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run AutoAgent
        uses: erans/autoagent@main
        env:
          CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
        with:
          custom: |
            Please review this pull request for:
            1. Code quality and best practices
            2. Security vulnerabilities
            3. Performance optimizations
            4. Documentation completeness
          action: comment
          install-agent: true
          agent: cursor
```

### Debug Logging Example

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues with file detection, agent execution, or other problems:

```yaml
name: AutoAgent with Debug Logging

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

jobs:
  autoagent:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Required for proper changed file detection
      - name: Run AutoAgent with Debug Output
        uses: erans/autoagent@main
        env:
          CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
        with:
          rules: |
            - owasp-check
            - code-review
          logging: debug  # Enable detailed debugging output
          agent: cursor
```

**Debug logging includes:**
- Detailed git diff strategies and results
- Changed file detection process
- Agent execution details and prompt lengths
- Rule processing steps and timings
- Error details and troubleshooting information

### Custom Rule Files Examples

AutoAgent supports custom rule files through the `customFiles` parameter, allowing you to create reusable, organization-specific analysis rules.

#### Basic Custom Files Example

```yaml
name: AutoAgent with Custom Rules

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write

jobs:
  autoagent:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Run AutoAgent with Custom Files
        uses: erans/autoagent@main
        env:
          CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
        with:
          rules: |
            - owasp-check
            - code-review
          customFiles: |
            - .github/rules/team-standards.prompt
            - .github/rules/api-guidelines.prompt
          agent: cursor
```

#### Repository-Specific Rules

Create custom rule files in your repository under `.github/rules/`:

**`.github/rules/team-standards.prompt`**:
```
Review the code for adherence to our team's coding standards:

## API Design Standards
- All API endpoints must use consistent naming (kebab-case)
- Response structures must include status, data, and meta fields
- Error responses must follow RFC 7807 problem details format

## Database Standards
- All queries must use prepared statements
- Table names must be snake_case
- Foreign key relationships must be explicitly defined

## Testing Requirements
- All public methods must have unit tests
- Integration tests required for API endpoints
- Test coverage must be > 80%

Provide specific violations found with file locations and recommended fixes.
```

**`.github/rules/api-guidelines.prompt`**:
```
Analyze the API implementation for compliance with our guidelines:

## REST API Standards
- Proper HTTP status codes usage
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Request/response validation
- Rate limiting implementation

## Security Requirements
- Input sanitization for all endpoints
- Authentication middleware on protected routes
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection measures

Report any deviations from these standards with specific remediation steps.
```

#### Shared Organization Rules

Use relative paths to reference shared rules from a parent directory or organization-wide rule repository:

```yaml
- name: Run AutoAgent with Shared Org Rules
  uses: erans/autoagent@main
  env:
    CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
  with:
    customFiles: |
      - ../shared-rules/org-security.prompt
      - ../shared-rules/performance-standards.prompt
      - .github/rules/local-overrides.prompt
    agent: cursor
```

#### Mixed Rules Configuration

Combine predefined rules, custom files, and custom prompts:

```yaml
- name: Comprehensive AutoAgent Analysis
  uses: erans/autoagent@main
  env:
    CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
  with:
    rules: |
      - owasp-check
      - secrets-detection
    customFiles: |
      - .github/rules/team-standards.prompt
      - .github/rules/performance-check.prompt
    custom: |
      Additionally, please verify that all new database migrations
      include proper rollback procedures and performance impact analysis.
    agent: cursor
```

#### JSON Format Support

CustomFiles also supports JSON array format:

```yaml
- name: AutoAgent with JSON Custom Files
  uses: erans/autoagent@main
  env:
    CURSOR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
  with:
    customFiles: '["./rules/custom.prompt", ".github/rules/standards.prompt"]'
    agent: cursor
```

#### File Path Resolution

- **Relative paths**: Resolved relative to the repository root (`$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`)
  - `./rules/custom.prompt` ‚Üí `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/rules/custom.prompt`
  - `.github/rules/team.prompt` ‚Üí `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/.github/rules/team.prompt`
  - `../shared/rule.prompt` ‚Üí Parent directory of workspace

- **Absolute paths**: Used as-is (with security validation)
  - `/home/runner/work/shared/rule.prompt`

- **Security features**:
  - File existence and readability validation
  - File size limits (max 1MB per file)
  - Path traversal protection
  - Graceful error handling for invalid files

#### Rule Naming in Comments

Custom rule files appear in PR comments using just the filename (without path or `.prompt` extension):

- `.github/rules/team-standards.prompt` appears as `team-standards`
- `../shared/org-security.prompt` appears as `org-security`
- `/absolute/path/api-check.prompt` appears as `api-check`
