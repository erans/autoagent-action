## Task: Code Duplication Analysis

Analyze the **files changed/added in this pull request** for potential code duplication and suggest existing code that could be reused instead of writing new code.

### Analysis Steps

1. **Identify Changed Files**
   - First, get the list of files changed in this PR using: `git diff --name-only HEAD~1`
   - Focus analysis only on files that were modified or added in this PR
   - Use `git diff` to see the specific changes made

2. **Identify New Code Patterns in Changed Files**
   - Look for functions, classes, methods, or code blocks that appear to be newly written
   - Focus on business logic, utility functions, data processing, and common operations
   - Pay attention to algorithms, data structures, and architectural patterns

3. **Search for Similar Existing Code**
   - Use `grep` to search for similar function names, variable names, or code patterns
   - Look for similar string literals, constants, or configuration patterns
   - Search for similar error handling, logging, or validation patterns
   - Check for similar API calls, database queries, or external service integrations
   - **Search scope**: Focus on the entire repository but prioritize files in the same directory or related modules

3. **AST-Based Analysis** (if available)
   - Use `ast-grep` or similar tools to find structurally similar code
   - Look for similar function signatures, class structures, or control flow patterns
   - Identify common patterns like validation, serialization, or data transformation

4. **Semantic Code Search**
   - Search for code that solves similar problems or implements similar functionality
   - Look for existing utilities, helpers, or shared libraries
   - Check for similar design patterns or architectural approaches

### Git Commands to Identify Changed Files

```bash
# Get list of files changed in this PR
git diff --name-only HEAD~1

# Get detailed diff of changes
git diff HEAD~1

# Get only added lines (new code)
git diff HEAD~1 | grep "^+"

# Get files changed with their status (A=added, M=modified, D=deleted)
git diff --name-status HEAD~1
```

### Search Commands to Use

```bash
# First, get the changed files
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only HEAD~1)

# Search for similar function names in changed files first, then broader
for file in $CHANGED_FILES; do
  echo "Analyzing changed file: $file"
  # Extract function names from changed file and search for similar ones
  grep -n "function\|def\|class\|const\|let\|var" "$file" | head -10
done

# Search for similar function names (prioritize same directory)
grep -r "function_name_pattern" . --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.py" --include="*.java" --include="*.go"

# Search for similar string literals or constants
grep -r "string_literal" . --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.py" --include="*.java" --include="*.go"

# Search for similar error handling patterns
grep -r "try.*catch\|if.*error\|throw.*Error" . --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.py" --include="*.java" --include="*.go"

# Search for similar API patterns
grep -r "fetch\|axios\|request\|http" . --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.py" --include="*.java" --include="*.go"

# Search for similar database patterns
grep -r "SELECT\|INSERT\|UPDATE\|DELETE\|query\|execute" . --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.py" --include="*.java" --include="*.go"

# Search for similar validation patterns
grep -r "validate\|check\|verify\|assert" . --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.py" --include="*.java" --include="*.go"

# Search for similar logging patterns
grep -r "log\|console\|print\|debug\|info\|warn\|error" . --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.py" --include="*.java" --include="*.go"
```

### Analysis Criteria

**High Priority Duplications:**
- Identical or nearly identical functions with different names
- Similar business logic implemented multiple times
- Duplicate validation, error handling, or utility functions
- Repeated configuration or setup code
- Similar data transformation or processing logic

**Medium Priority Duplications:**
- Similar patterns with minor variations
- Code that could be abstracted into a shared utility
- Repeated architectural patterns
- Similar API integration patterns

**Low Priority Duplications:**
- Similar variable names or constants
- Similar comments or documentation
- Similar import statements or dependencies

### Output Format

For each potential duplication found:

1. **Location**: File and line numbers of the new code
2. **Similar Code**: File and line numbers of existing similar code
3. **Similarity Level**: High/Medium/Low
4. **Suggestion**: Specific recommendation for refactoring or reuse
5. **Code Snippets**: Show both the new code and similar existing code
6. **Refactoring Steps**: Concrete steps to eliminate duplication

### Example Output

## üîç Code Duplication Analysis

### High Priority: Duplicate User Validation

**New Code**: `src/auth/validator.js:15-25`
**Similar Code**: `src/utils/validation.js:45-55`

**Similarity**: High - Nearly identical validation logic

**New Code:**
```javascript
function validateUser(user) {
  if (!user.email || !user.email.includes('@')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email');
  }
  if (!user.password || user.password.length < 8) {
    throw new Error('Password too short');
  }
}
```

**Existing Code:**
```javascript
function validateEmail(email) {
  if (!email || !email.includes('@')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid email');
  }
}

function validatePassword(password) {
  if (!password || password.length < 8) {
    throw new Error('Password too short');
  }
}
```

**Suggestion**: Use existing validation functions instead of duplicating logic.

**Refactoring Steps**:
1. Import `validateEmail` and `validatePassword` from `src/utils/validation.js`
2. Replace custom validation with: `validateEmail(user.email); validatePassword(user.password);`
3. Remove duplicate validation function
```

### Focus Areas

**Primary Focus (Changed Files):**
- Analyze only the files that were modified or added in this PR
- Look for new functions, classes, or code blocks that might duplicate existing functionality
- Check if new code could reuse existing utilities or helpers

**Secondary Focus (Repository-wide Search):**
- Search the entire repository for similar patterns to the code in changed files
- Prioritize files in the same directory or related modules
- Look for existing code that could be refactored to eliminate duplication

**Specific Areas to Check:**
- **Utility Functions**: Look for common operations that could be shared
- **Validation Logic**: Check for repeated input validation patterns
- **Error Handling**: Identify similar error handling approaches
- **API Integration**: Look for repeated external service calls
- **Data Processing**: Find similar data transformation logic
- **Configuration**: Check for repeated setup or configuration code

### Tools to Use

- `grep` for text-based pattern matching
- `find` to locate files by type or name
- `git log` to see recent changes and understand context
- `git blame` to understand who wrote similar code
- Manual code review for semantic similarity

**IMPORTANT: Only provide the final analysis results. Do not show your thinking process, intermediate steps, or work-in-progress.**
